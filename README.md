# Leetcode Solutions Repository

Welcome to my Leetcode solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to Leetcode problems implemented in Python. Additionally, I've included sources that I'm referring to as part of my journey to learn data structures and algorithms.


The repository is organized into categories and difficulty levels, making it easy to navigate. Each problem has its dedicated folder containing the solution code, a README explaining the problem, and any additional notes.

Feel free to explore and use these solutions as a resource for learning and practicing algorithmic problem-solving.

## Sources

As part of my learning journey, I'm referring to the following sources:

- # TakeUforward - Youtube channel for covering an entire topic with curated problems.
- # Aditya_Verma - Youtube channel for pen and pencil explanation of the Problem.

## Coding Standards

The code in this repository follows consistent coding standards and conventions. I've focused on creating clean, readable, and well-documented solutions. 

Happy coding!
